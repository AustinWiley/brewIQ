# BeerKan

A beer tracking app for the professional Brewer and the avid homebrewer that works like a Kanban Board.  BeerKan as a digital Brew log allowing the user to track each batch of beer from raw ingredient to keg. This app is for the Brewer who is always juggling too many batches of beer at a time that he/she cant always remember where in the process every batch is.  Allows the brewer to be more efficient, brew more beer and archive all brewlogs.
